# Android Code Challenge: Real-Time Watchlist

## Overview

Build a small Android app that lets a user search for financial instruments, add them to a watchlist, and see real-time price updates.

This exercise is intentionally open-ended. We are more interested in your engineering decisions than in a large feature set. A smaller app with well-organized, maintainable code and thoughtful tradeoffs is preferred over a broad but fragile implementation.

## API

Use Finnhub:

- REST API documentation: https://finnhub.io/docs/api
- WebSocket documentation: https://finnhub.io/docs/api/websocket-trades

You may use stocks, crypto, forex, or a mix of instruments supported by Finnhub.

Finnhub is an external service with plan limits and market-data availability constraints. Document any assumptions or limitations in your README.

The app should also include a documented demo or fake-data mode so reviewers can run the core experience without depending on external service availability, market hours, or rate limits.

## Product Goal

Create a real-time price tracker with a user-managed watchlist.

The user should be able to:

- Search for instruments.
- Add and remove instruments from a watchlist.
- See the latest known price for each watchlist item.
- Receive live price updates while the app is running.
- Understand loading, empty, error, stale-data, and reconnecting states.

## Technical Expectations

Use:

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Coroutines and Flow
- Dependency injection
- A local persistence mechanism for the watchlist
- Relevant unit tests

## Requirements

- Use REST for instrument search and initial quote/snapshot data.
- Use WebSocket streaming for live price updates.
- Persist the watchlist across app launches.
- Expose screen state in a way that Compose can observe safely.
- Handle API errors, empty results, missing prices, network loss, and stream reconnects.
- Provide a README with setup instructions, architecture notes, tradeoffs, and any AI/tooling assistance used.

## Optional Enhancements

These are not required:

- Price movement indicators.
- Sorting or filtering the watchlist.
- Basic chart or sparkline.
- Pull to refresh.
- Offline cache display.
- UI tests or screenshot tests.
- More advanced retry/backoff behavior.

## Time Box

Please spend no more than 6-8 hours. You will have 3 days to complete and submit the assignment. It is acceptable to leave some polish or optional work unfinished if the important decisions are visible and explained.

## Submission

Submit a repository or archive containing:

- The Android project.
- Build and run instructions.
- Notes about demo/fake-data mode.
- A short explanation of your architecture and tradeoffs.
- A summary of relevant tests and how to run them.
